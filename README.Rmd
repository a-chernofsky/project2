# Project 2

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of project2 is to ...

## Installation

You can install the released version of project2 from the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("a-chernofsky/project2")
```

## Prerequisites

```{r}

library(survival)
library(interval)
library(project2)

```


## Simulating Cox Proportional Hazards model data

Assume $T \sim Exp(\lambda)$ with 
```{r}
#simulate covariates
x1 <- rbinom(100, 1, 0.5)
x2 <- rnorm(100)
x3 <- factor(sample(c(1,2,3), size = 100, replace = T, prob = c(0.33, 0.33, 0.33)))

b <- c(0.5, -0.02, 0.1, 0.1)

simdata <- sim_cph(100, formula = ~ x1 + x2 + x3, beta = b, tfun = texp(0.1))
simdata$event <- 1

sfit <- survfit(Surv(t, event) ~ x1, data =simdata)
summary(sfit)
plot(sfit)
```

## Simulating interval censored data

## Calculating RMST with right censored data

## Calculating RMST with interval censored data

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(project2)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
